            Jacobs Store
Meeting: 24th April, 2017 | 10:30pm

Agenda:
1. User Feedback
    Number of users reached out to = 10
    Number of users responded = 3
    a. User Pain Points from the feedback:
    - Having to constantly check emails.
    - People not getting back to them.
    - Making it clear that an item has been reserved/sold.
    - Getting too many emails back even after item sold.
    - Too many people pulling out of a sale halfway.
    - Contacting people to meet up is also a hassle.

    Thoughts from User Feedback
    We are trying to solve:
    - There seems to be a lot unnecessary communication
    - People are willing to use multiple social media platforms because there are other people using them.
      (Snowball effect)
    - People will use something if it is convenient.

2. Prototyping
    The team worked on first prototypes of the platform.

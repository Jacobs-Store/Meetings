2. Project Overview:
    a. Problem Scope:

    Currently, people use emails to buy and sell stuff on campus amongst the student body.
    Advantages of this have been:
        - Because everyone can see it.
        - The emails come from and go to just Jacobs people not some unknown person.

        - Inability to filter the emails.
        - Some people never have cash on them to go pay people.
        - Not sure if the product is sold or not.
        - You have to hunt for the person's contact information.
        - Products are sold too quickly. You really have to be on top of your inbox to catch what you need.
        - You have to click on Google Docs. Another platform:(
